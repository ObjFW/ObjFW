 * Reworked exceptions API that explicitly passes errno around
 + OFHTTPClient: Keep-alive and Basic Authorization support
 + Support for (and use of) ObjC generics, nullability and kindof
 + Fast path for resolving classes when using GCC (Clang doesn't need the fast
   path, as it directly references classes)

   problems with newer Clang versions
 * More use of OF_SENTINEL

ObjFW 0.6 -> ObjFW 0.7, 27.10.2012
 Again, the differences are more than in any release before, thus listing them
 all would be too much. The major differences are:
 + ObjFW now comes with its own runtime, which greatly increases performance
   compared to the GNU runtime and is even faster than the Apple runtime
   (using Clang >= 3.2 is recommended, but not necessary)
 * Support for the GNU runtime has been dropped
 + New, much faster autorelease pool implementation (now inside the runtime)
 + Support for Automatic Reference Counting (requires Clang >= 3.2)
 + Forwarding has been implemented
 + Asynchronous stream handling
 + New classes: OFThreadPool, OFRecursiveMutex, OFSortedList, OFTimer, OFRunLoop
 + New protocols: OFLocking, OFTLSSocket
 * Lots of API changes to make APIs more future-proof
 + Support for the new Objective-C literals
 * OFHTTPRequest now implements HTTP/1.1
 * OFObject's memory handling has been improved, leading to better performance
 * Strings are allocated faster now
 + Support for JSON5
 * All private methods use the prefix OF_ now instead of _, making it possible
   to use the _ prefix in applications
 * Most ObjC compiler feature checks are not part of configure anymore, making
   it possible to use the same installation with different compilers

ObjFW 0.5.4 -> ObjFW 0.6, 27.02.2012
 The differences between 0.5.4 and 0.6 are too big to list them all. However,
 the major new features are:
 * OFString, OFArray, OFDictionary, OFSet and OFCountedSet are now class
   clusters
 + Serialization and deserialization of objects into/from XML and JSON
 + New class OFIntrospection for introspecting classes
 + New class OFProcess for working with and controlling child processes
 * Lots of OFXMLParser and OFXMLElement improvements
 + OFHTTPRequests can have a delegate now for status updates and processing
   data as soon as it arrives
 + There are several backends for OFStreamObserver now, including kqueue, poll
   and select
 + SOCKS5 support for OFTCPSockets (client only)
 * Several API changes

   the last bucket is already used when the dictionary is resized
 * The mutations pointer is now correctly initialized in enumerators for
   immutable collections

ObjFW 0.2.1 -> 0.3, 09.05.2010
 + Many new methods were added to different classes
 + A huge amount of methods was added to OFStream, allowing easy binary
   stream handling and even mixing string-based and binary operations
 + An optional write buffer was added to OFStream
 + OFSeekableStream was added for streams that allow seeking, for example
   OFFiles
 * OFNumber was completely reworked and got many new features now
 * Large parts of OFDictionary were rewritten for better readability, better
   memory usage and to fix a bug with removing objects
 * OFThread has been greatly improved
 * Many small optimizations
 * Many documentation improvements
 * Method replacing was reworked and the methods renamed
 + Tests for OFStream were added
 * A bug with building ObjFW as a Universal Binary Framework was fixed
 + Support for ObjFW-RT, the ObjFW Objective C runtime, was added
 * Sockets are now properly closed before an exception is thrown

   used on of_stdin and fixing many other annoyances
 * A few misc methods were renamed
 + OFApplication was added
 * All tests and the table generator are now using OFApplication
 + It is now possible to get the remote address of an OFTCPSocket
 + OFString can now build paths in the OS-native format
 + It is now possible to create a string with the contents of a file
 + Many new file operations were added to OFFile
 * The existing file operations in OFFile were improved
 * Almost all functions that returned self before now return void
 + OFHash was added as a superclass for OFMD5Hash and OFSHA1Hash and OFHashes
   renamed to OFHash
 + objfw-compile was added for easy compilation of ObjFW projects, which
   includes dependency checking for headers etc.
 * The instance variable naming convention was changed so that properties work
 + Properties were added to the interfaces and are used if they are supported
   by the compiler
 + The library version is now included in the resulting dylib and libobjc is
   reexported now. Additionally, objfw-config offers --reexport now to produce
   libraries that link against ObjFW and reexport it

ObjFW 0.2 -> 0.2.1, 14.03.2010
 * Fix for OFNumbers not doing calculations
 * Improved -[hash] for OFNumbers with floats and doubles
 + Tests for OFNumber
 * Small optimization for OFArray's -[componentsJoinedByString:]
 * Documentation improvements
 * Updated copyright

ObjFW 0.1.2 -> 0.2, 01.02.2010
 + Support for ObjC 2 Fast Enumerations on every platform which has
   compiler support for fast enumerations
 + Support for ObjC 2 properties on every platform with compiler support
 + Fast Enumeration through arrays and dictionaries
 * OFIterator has been removed
 + OFEnumerator was added to replace OFIterator, which is more general
   and works with arrays and dictionaries
 + Portable implementation for atomic operations
 + Portable implementation for spinlocks. They use atomic operations if
   available, if not they fall back to pthread spinlocks. If both are
   unavailable, mutexes are used as a last fallback
 * -[retain] and -[release] are now atomic. If no atomic operations are
   available, spinlocks are used (which can fall back to mutexes, see
   above)
 * -[readLine] now handles \r\n without having the \r included in the
   returned line
 + OFThread now has -[tryLock]
 * Mutation methods have been removed from immutable interfaces, thus
   already giving an error at compilation instead of at runtime
 * Dependencies between headers have been reduced, leading to faster
   compile times
 * The interfaces of OFSocket and OFStream were cleaned up and some
   methods were moved to OFTCPSocket, as they make sense only there
 * File methods unavailable on Windows don't throw an exception at
   runtime anymore, but instead are not even in the interface on
   Windows. This way, it is a compile time error instead of a runtime
   error

ObjFW 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2, 15.01.2010
 * Fix a bug in OFMutableArray's -[removeObject:] and
   -[removeObjectIdenticalTo:] that could lead to not removing all
   occurrences of the object from the array and to out of bounds reads
 * Change the URL in the framework plist to the homepage

ObjFW 0.1 -> 0.1.1, 04.01.2010
 * Fix a missing out of range check for -[removeNItems:atIndex:] that
   allowed the programmer to specify too big ranges so it would crash
   instead of throwing an exception
 * Fix missing calls to -[retain] and -[autorelease] when getting
   objects from an OFArray or OFDictionary
 * Safer and more fault-tolerant way to remove objects from an
   OFMutableArray
 * Calling +[dealloc] throws an exception now. If someone really calls
   [SomeClass dealloc], this should be punished and not ignored, as
   this is a serious programmer error
 * -[readLineWithEncoding:] is more fault-tolerant now and does not
   lose data when it stumbles upon invalid encoding. Instead, it allows
   recalling with the correct encoding now

ObjFW 0.1, 24.12.2009
 + Initial release

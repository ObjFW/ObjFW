What is ObjFW?
==============

[ObjFW](https://objfw.nil.im/) is a portable, lightweight framework for the
Objective-C language. It enables you to write an application in Objective-C
that will run on any [platform](PLATFORMS.md) supported by ObjFW without having
to worry about differences between operating systems or various frameworks you
would otherwise need if you want to be portable.

It supports all modern Objective-C features when using Clang, but is also
compatible with GCC ≥ 4.6 to allow maximum portability.

ObjFW is intentionally incompatible with Foundation. This has two reasons:

 * GNUstep already provides a reimplementation of Foundation, which is only
   compatible to a certain degree. This means that a developer still needs to
   care about differences between frameworks if they want to be portable. The
   idea behind ObjFW is that developers do not need to concern themselves with
   portability and making sure their code works with multiple frameworks:
   Instead, if it works with ObjFW on one platform, they can reasonably expect
   it to also work with ObjFW on another platform. ObjFW behaving differently
   on different operating systems (unless inevitable because it is a
   platform-specific part, like the Windows Registry) is considered a bug and
   will be fixed.
 * Foundation predates a lot of modern Objective-C concepts. The most prominent
   one is exceptions, which are only used in Foundation as a replacement for
   `abort()`. This results in cumbersome error handling, especially in
   initializers, which in Foundation only return `nil` on error with no
   indication of what went wrong. It also means that the return of every `init`
   call needs to be checked against `nil`. But in the wild, nobody actually
   checks *each and every* return from `init` against `nil`, leading to bugs.
   ObjFW fixes this by making exceptions a first class citizen.

You can read more about the differences to Foundation
[here](https://git.nil.im/ObjFW/ObjFW/wiki/Differences-to-Foundation).

ObjFW also comes with its own lightweight and extremely fast Objective-C
runtime, which in real world use cases was found to be significantly faster
than both GNU's and Apple's runtime.


Installation
============

You can either follow the [instructions](INSTALLATION.md) to install ObjFW or
you can [build ObjFW from source](COMPILING.md).


Usage
=====

To create your first, empty application, you can use `objfw-new`:

    objfw-new --app MyFirstApp

This creates a file `MyFirstApp.m`. The `-[applicationDidFinishLaunching:]`
method is called as soon as ObjFW finished all initialization. Use this as the
entry point to your own code. For example, you could add the following line
there to create a "Hello World":

    [OFStdOut writeLine: @"Hello World!"];

You can compile your new app using `objfw-compile`:

    objfw-compile -o MyFirstApp MyFirstApp.m

`objfw-compile` is a tool that allows building applications and libraries using
ObjFW without needing a full-blown build system. If you want to use your own
build system, you can get the necessary flags from `objfw-config`.


Documentation
=============

You can find the documentation for the latest released version of ObjFW
[here](https://objfw.nil.im/docs/).

In order to build the documentation yourself (necessary to have documentation
for trunk / master), you need to have [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl)
installed. Once installed, you can build the documentation from the root
directory of the repository:

    make docs

Support and community
=====================

If you have any questions about ObjFW or would like to talk to other ObjFW
users, the following venues are available:
